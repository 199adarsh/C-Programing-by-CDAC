# C Programming – CDAC 20-Day Workshop

This repo is my personal collection of C programming exercises, notes, and solutions from a 20-day CDAC workshop. Each folder represents a day’s worth of problems, and every `.c` file is a hands-on example or assignment I tackled during the course.

---

## 📅 Workshop Structure

- **20 days** of focused C programming
- Daily folders: `D01/`, `D02/`, ..., `D20/`
- Each folder contains:
  - Numbered `.c` files for each exercise
  - An `output/` folder with compiled `.exe` files

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Browse by Day:**  
   Each `DXX/` folder = one day’s exercises.

2. **Compile:**  
   ```sh
   gcc 01.c -o output/01.exe
   ```

3. **Run:**  
   ```sh
   ./output/01.exe
   ```

4. **Batch Compile (Windows):**  
   ```sh
   for %f in (*.c) do gcc "%f" -o "output/%~nf.exe"
   ```
